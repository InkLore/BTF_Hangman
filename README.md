# BTF_Hangman
Back To the Future Hangman

This repository includes a simple *Back To the Future* hangman game, implemented a few different ways. The original Python version was a highschool project from my Junior year of highschool. The updated Python and C++ implementations are from the summer before my Junior year of college. A Rust version is upcoming.
